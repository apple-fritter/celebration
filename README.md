### Features
Notable features include a visually appealing divider displaying the time and date stamp between prompts, which enhances the shell's appearance and aids in debugging:

#### Source
```shell
# Prompt command to print a graphical divider with time and date stamp between shell prompts.
function separator {
    local datestring=$(date +"%Y%m%d, %A")       # Get the current date and day of the week
    local timestring=$(date +"%H%M%S")           # Get the current time
    local daylength=${#datestring}               # Length of the date and day string
    local dashlength=$(( 80 - daylength - ${#timestring} ))  # Length of dashes to fill remaining space
    local dashes=$(printf "%-${dashlength}s" "-")  # Fill the remaining length with dashes
    local line="$datestring $dashes $timestring"  # Construct the full divider line
    printf "%s\n%s\n" "$line"
}
```

#### Example Output
```shell
20230615, Thursday ---------------------------- 132900
```

#### Separator Explained

##### `datestring`
This variable stores the formatted current date and day of the week, using the format `%Y%m%d, %A`. For example, it might be "20230615, Thursday".

##### `timestring`
This variable stores the formatted current time, using the format `%H%M%S`. For example, it might be "132900" for 1:29 PM.

##### `daylength`
This variable calculates the length of the datestring using `${#datestring}`. It represents the number of characters in the combined date and day of the week.

##### `dashlength`
This variable calculates the length of dashes to fill the remaining space on the line. It is determined by subtracting the `daylength` and the length of `timestring` from the fixed width of `80` characters.
> This ensures that the divider line will always have a length of 80 characters, which can often be the default value width of a terminal window. This value can be changed to better reflect the user's indended design considerations.

##### `dashes`
This variable uses printf to generate a string of dashes (-) with a length equal to dashlength. The `%-${dashlength}s` format specifier is used to left-align the dashes within the specified length.

##### `line`
This variable concatenates the datestring, dashes, and timestring together with spaces to construct the full divider line. It follows the format `<datestring> <dashes> <timestring>`.

##### `printf "%s\n%s\n" "$line"`
This line uses `printf` to print the line, followed by a newline character `\n`, to display the divider line.

### Prompt levels

PS1 and PS2 have been defined, enhancing the prompt's appearance.

```shell
PS1='[\u \h] \w '
PS2='▓▒░ '
```
PS1='[\u \h] \w ', sets the prompt to display the username , hostname, and current working directory, such as `[user hostname] /home/user/`.

PS2='▓▒░ ' sets the secondary prompt to show a pattern of block characters. This prompt level provides visual indication that more input is expected.

---

The `.bashrc` files also comprise various settings and aliases that streamline frequently used commands, making them more efficient while the history command and history ignoring commands' format have been tailored to enhance productivity, and they includes aliases for referencing system management shell scripts also provided in this repository.

##### Establish the time format for long-running commands
```shell
export TIMEFORMAT=$'\nreal %3R\tuser %3U\tsys %3S\tpcpu %P\n'
```

##### Provide aliases for disk usage and space
```shell
alias du='du -kh'
alias df='df -kTh'
```

##### Show files with color and long format
```shell
alias ls='ls -aclX --color'
```

##### Create an alias to notify users when a long-running command completes
```shell
alias alert='notify-send --urgency=low -i "$([ $? = 0 ] && echo terminal || echo error)" "$(
    history | tail -n1 | sed -e '\''s/^\s*[0-9]\+\s*//;s/[;&|]\s*alert$//'\''
)"'

```
##### Specify default wget arguments to appear as a web browser request, supporting download resumes
```shell
alias wget='wget -c --user-agent="Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Ubuntu 23.04; rv:109.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/109.0"'
```

## Scripts:
### Superuser scripts:
#### [cleaning_routine.admin.sh](https://github.com/apple-fritter/celebration/blob/main/root/cleaning_routine.admin.sh)
Executes a sequence of cleanup tasks to optimize system performance. It scans for all schema files that are not utilized by any installed applications and removes them to free up space.

```
┌─ Start Script
│
├─ Clean up home directory
│   ├─ Remove .cache/ directory
│   └─ Remove .wget-hsts
│
├─ Check if the schema directory exists
│   ├─ Directory doesn't exist
│   │       └─ Display "Directory <schema_dir> not found." and exit
│   └─ Continue to next step
│
├─ Find unused schema files
│   ├─ Find all schema files in <schema_dir> that don't contain "gettext"
│   └─ Store list of unused schema files in UNUSED_SCHEMAS
│
├─ Remove unused schema files
│   ├─ Loop for each schema in UNUSED_SCHEMAS
│   │       ├─ Remove the schema file
│   │       └─ Display "Removed <schema_file>"
│   └─ Compile the remaining schema files
│
├─ Clean up
│   ├─ bash history
│   ├─ backup files
│   ├─ DS_Store files
│   ├─ Thumbs.db files
│   ├─ tmp files
│   ├─ Java cache
│   ├─ SQLite3 history
│   ├─ system cache
│   ├─ rotated logs
│   ├─ trash
│   ├─ thumbnail cache
│   └─ X11 debug logs
│
├─ Remove packages that are no longer needed
├─ Clear the local package cache
│
└─ End Script
```

#### [nodupes.sh](https://github.com/apple-fritter/celebration/blob/main/root/nodupes.sh)
Sorts a text file alphabetically and eliminates duplicated lines, saving time and effort while ensuring data accuracy and integrity. 

```
┌─ Start Script
│
├─ Sort the contents of file <input_file>
│     └─ Store the sorted output in a temporary file <input_file>.tmp
│
├─ Remove duplicate lines from the sorted output
│     └─ Store the unique lines in the temporary file <input_file>.tmp
│
├─ Rename the temporary file <input_file>.tmp to <input_file>
│
└─ End Script
```

#### [update_installed_packages.sh](https://github.com/apple-fritter/celebration/blob/main/root/update_installed_packages.sh)
Automates the process of updating all installed software packages on your system. By running the script from a root prompt, it will automatically search for and install any available updates. This saves time and effort while also keeping your system secure and up-to-date.
```
┌─ Start Script
│
├─ Run apt-get update command
│     └─ Automatically answer "yes" to any prompts
│
├─ Run apt-get dist-upgrade command
│     └─ Automatically answer "yes" to any prompts
│
└─ End Script
```

#### [unclefill.sh](https://github.com/apple-fritter/celebration/blob/main/root/unclefill.sh)
Quickly fills a target file with a specified input pattern, making it useful for generating large amounts of sample data for testing or demonstration purposes.
```
┌─ Start Script
│
├─ Define input_file and output_file variables from command line arguments
│     └─ Assign the value of the first command line argument to input_file
│     └─ Assign the value of the second command line argument to output_file
│
├─ Check if either input_file or output_file is empty
│     ├─ If either file is empty
│     │     └─ Prompt user for input file path
│     │     └─ Prompt user for output file path
│     └─ If both input_file and output_file are provided
│           └─ Check if the number of arguments is greater than 2
│                 └─ Display an error message to stderr
│                 └─ Exit the script with status code 1
│
├─ Use a while loop to continuously append input_file contents to output_file
│     └─ Append the contents of input_file to output_file
│
└─ End Script
```

> The while loop continuously appends the contents of the input file to the output file indefinitely, which may result in an infinite loop. You may want to consider adding a condition or an exit condition within the loop to ensure it doesn't run indefinitely.
